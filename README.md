# GeneticImage_Demo
Demonstration of basic Genetic Algorithm applied to image reproduction

This demonstration was used for an intern talk at Appstud company about AI.

## Prerequisites

- Get jupyter-notebook : https://jupyter.org/
- Get Calysto Processing kernel : https://github.com/Calysto/calysto_processing
- Get Processing : https://processing.org/

## Quick start

- Launch `jupyter-notebook`in command-line
- Open GeneticImage.ipynb on your browser (localhost:8888 by default)
- Select Calysto Processing kernel in toolbar
- Launch Processing application on the side
- Install processing-java through Processing UI (Tools > Install processing-java)
- Crongrats, you should be able to launch the demo !

## Known issues

On MacOS, processing-java has weird behaviour and tends to uninstall. The quick fix is to install again processing-java when necessary.
